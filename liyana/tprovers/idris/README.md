# Notes:
Some useful options to the Idris command are:
- `-o prog` to compile to an executable called `prog`.
- `--check` type check the file and its dependencies without starting the interactive environment.
- `--package pkg` add package as dependency, e.g. `--package contrib` to make use of the contrib package.
- `--help` display usage summary and command line options.
